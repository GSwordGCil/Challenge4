In this challenge I create a quiz for javascript knowledge that has a timer of 90 seconds with 10 questions. Upon choosing the wrong answer, user will lose 10 seconds. The final score will be equivilant to the time left on the timer. User is able to save their intials and time in local storage and have the option to go back to the main page and start the quiz over. User also has the option to show top scores locally stored at any time. However, doing so will terminate any on going quiz and set the score to 0. A reset button is also present for user to reset locally store scores.# Challenge4
